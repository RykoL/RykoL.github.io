I am **Rico Lang**, a software consultant from Germany. At the
beginning of my professional career in the CGI field I wasn't
necessarily strong in the visual part, but instead I specialized
myself in backend development. A few years later I consider myself being a generalist, setting foot in the Fullstack world. Additional I like functional programming, Linux and who couldâ€™ve guessed **Emacs** .

Enjoy reading this blog and expect read some weird findings during my work as developer !
